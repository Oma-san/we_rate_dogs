### Introduction

I wrangled, analyzed and visualized the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also
known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with
humorous comments about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of
10 and a numerator usually above 10.

### Insights
After wrangling the data, I found out that:
1. The average rating for the dogs was around 12 This means if a dog got a rating higher
than 12, the dog was better than your average dog.
2. I ran a correlation analysis, which showed that there is a strong positive relationship
between the number of times a dog tweet is favorited and when it is retweeted and there is also a good relationship between both retweet and favorite count and the rating the dog
gets (when outliers were removed).
3. A machine learning model was used to identify the dog breed in the images and there
were several images that the machine learning model could not identify the dog in them
with significant confidence but where the model could identify the dog breed, the soft
coated wheaten terrier had the highest rating, followed by the west highland white terrier
breed.
4. The dog with the highest rating was Atticus.
